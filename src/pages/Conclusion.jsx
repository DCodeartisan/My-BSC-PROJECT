        The objective of the study was to examine the effect of inductive and deductive methods of teaching on secondary school students' achievement in mathematics. Three research question was raised and one hypothesis was also drawn, this was to enable the researcher achieve the stated objective. Literature from scholar and researcher were reviewed and a quasi-experiment design was adopted as the research design. An achievement test designed by the researcher was used to test the students. A sample of one hundred and eighty-three (183) respondents was used. The data collected was analysed and the finding discovered that the students that were taught with the inductive method were found to have high achievement scores in the Mathematics Achievement Test (MAT) then followed by the students taught with the deductive method had high scores in the MAT than those in the control group that were taught with the conventional method of teaching. Based on the hypotheses, there is significant difference in the achievement scores between students taught Mathematics with inductive method than those taught with the deductive method or conventional method.

      <p className='py-6'>
        In wrapping up the study, the results substantiate the superiority of the inductive teaching method in fostering academic success among secondary school students in mathematics when compared to the deductive approach. The inductive method's hands-on and experiential learning approach enables students to actively participate in the learning process, facilitating a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. By encouraging students to analyze specific instances, identify patterns, and generalize conclusions, the inductive method nurtures critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities crucial for mastering mathematical principles.
        <br /><br />
        The research outcomes advocate for the integration of inductive teaching strategies within mathematics classrooms to optimize students' learning experiences and outcomes. The interactive nature of the inductive method not only enhances students' comprehension and retention of mathematical content but also cultivates a sense of curiosity and exploration, fostering a positive attitude towards learning. By promoting student engagement and autonomy in the learning process, the inductive approach empowers students to take ownership of their education and develop essential skills that transcend the realm of mathematics.
        <br /><br />
        Moving forward, continued exploration and implementation of innovative teaching methodologies, such as inductive instruction, hold promise for enriching mathematics education and promoting student success. Embracing pedagogical approaches that prioritize active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving can pave the way for a more dynamic and effective educational landscape, equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed to excel academically and beyond.

        Based on the findings and conclusion of the study, the following recommendations were proffered:
      </p>
      <ul className='list-decimal list-inside space-y-3'>
        <li>
          Secondary school teachers should be discouraged from the continuous use of conventional method in the teaching of mathematics as the method make students performed poorly in the MAT tasks in mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          The findings of the study revealed that significant differences existed in the mean achievement scores in favour of the students taught mathematics using inductive method as opposed to those taught with the conventional method. This requires teachers to make efforts to integrate thoroughly inductive method into the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Text-book authors should consider it as a priority, to include in their texts, the effective use and application of inductive method in the teaching and learning of mathematics so the teachers and learners should apply them when the need arises.
