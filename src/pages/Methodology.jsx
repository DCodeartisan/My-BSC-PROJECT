      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.2</span> research design
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        This study adopts a quasi-experimental, pre-test, post-test experimental and control design. Intact classes were used for the study. The intact classes were assigned randomly to experimental and control groups. A pre-test was administered to both the experimental group and control group to determine if any difference existed in the ability of the two groups before treatment. The experimental group received treatments after which a post-test was administered to both groups thereafter.

      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        This work titled Effect of Inductive and Deductive Method of Teaching on Students Achievement in Mathematics was carried out in Lagos state education district IV.

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.4</span> population of the study
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        The set population for the study consists of all public senior secondary school students in Lagos state education district IV. There are six education Districts in Lagos state: Districts I, II, III, IV, V and VI.
      </p>

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.5</span> sample and sampling techniques
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        An intact class was used for the purpose of the research. Purposive sampling technique was employed to select schools based on co-educational status of the school and schools that have been presenting students for the National Certificate Examination. The simple random sampling technique was used to select the sample for this study, so that every member of the population had an equal chance of being selected. The schools selected is given below:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pb-6">
        <li>Akintan Senior Grammar School</li>
        <li>Birrel Avenue Senior High School</li>
        <li>Lagos City Senior College</li>
        <li>Stadium Senior High School</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.6</span> research instruments
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        One structured research instrument; the Mathematics Achievement Test (MAT) consisted of two sections, Section A and Section B. Section A focused on the personal data of the students such as age, sex, class, time duration, and name of school. Section B focused on 20 items objective test on Circle Geometry, of option A-D with only one correct answer while others were distractor were used in data collection. The questions were constructed from the New General Mathematics Textbook for senior secondary schools 2 by MF Macrae, AO Kalejaiye, ZI Chima, GU Garba, MO Ademosu.

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.7</span> validity of the instrument
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        To ensure the content and face validity of the instrument, the draft copy of the research instrument (Mathematics Achievement Test) was given to an expert in mathematics education for review and possible modification. Based on the corrections, the final copy was prepared and used for data collection.
      </p>

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.8</span> reliability of the instrument
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        The researcher used a test re-test method to ensure the reliability of the research instrument. This was carried out by administering the Mathematics Achievement Test twice to the same set of students (few outside the sample selected as representative of the study) within a given period of time between the two periods of administration of which the testees' responses will be correlated so as to determine the correlation coefficient.
      </p>

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.9</span> method of data collection and administration
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        The research utilized primary and secondary sources of information for data collection. The research instrument (Mathematics Achievement Test) was administered to respondents directly. Respondents were briefed on how to complete the research instrument and assured of the importance and confidentiality of the information to be supplied. Secondary sources used were journals and publications of materials related to the problem under investigation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="uppercase">
        <span className="pr-4">3.10</span> methods of data analysis
      </h2>
      <p className='py-6'>
        The researcher used descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation to summarize the data. Inferential statistics which include Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to control the pre-test and post-test differences and examine the effect of the treatment, and Paired Samples T-test to compare the post-test scores between the experimental and control groups.
