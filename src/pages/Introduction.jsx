        Mathematics is a diverse field of science that entails numbers, and multiple operations are carried out using them. It involves operations such as calculations, computations, and solving problems. Mathematics is defined in the Oxford Dictionary (fourth edition) as the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It involves using logical reasoning and critical thinking to solve problems. Mathematics is also defined as the science of logic, structure, order, and arrangement. It is a subject described by preciseness, exactness, critical approach, and being logical. Mathematics is further explained as an investigation involving structure, quantity, space, and transformation. Traditionally, mathematics has developed through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, from counting, measuring, calculating, and structuring physical objects, motion, and shape.

        In this age of science and technology, mathematics is playing a very promising role, human beings would not be able to explore outer space, nor one plan to land on Mars without mathematics. Obafemi and Ogunkunle (2013) acknowledged that Mathematics is the universal language of science. Mathematics holds a vital role in the education system, serving as one of the fundamental subjects across all levels of schooling. Mathematics enhances the power of reasoning, creativity, abstract thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving ability and effective communication skills Adeniyi & Akinoso (2019). Its significance extends beyond academics, as it plays a crucial role in everyday life and serves as a foundation for further studies in science and technology. Moreover, mathematics is closely intertwined with disciplines such as logic, social studies, arts, music, and literature. By applying mathematical concepts, skills, and logical reasoning, students acquire the ability to solve various problems they encounter in their lives.

        Academic achievement, in essence, refers to the knowledge acquired by a learner through education. This knowledge is gained through instructions provided by teachers in school, where various tasks are assigned to students and their work is evaluated and compared for quality. Unlike the family, the school environment offers a diverse range of experiences that contribute to academic achievement (Tucker, 2008; Zayco, 2002; & Sullivan, 2009). These factors hold significant importance for educational researchers and other related disciplines. Particular attention is given to the student's sense of self as a key component of academic achievement.
        <br /><br />
        According to Akomolafe (2010), academic achievement is influenced by several factors including the student's attitude, interests, personal characteristics, motivation, and social class. These elements, alongside the learning process itself, have a known impact on students' academic performance. Notably, the concept of achievement motivation is often associated with academic achievement. Hence, the ultimate objective of learning mathematics is to equip students with problem-solving skills specific to the subject. Consequently, both students and teachers have a vested interest in ensuring that the teaching of mathematics is effective, leading to a better understanding and improved performance in the subject. The teaching method employed in mathematics education holds great importance. Mathematics teachers employ diverse methods and techniques to create an interactive and collaborative classroom environment. The interaction between teachers and students is a crucial aspect of schooling. These methods are influenced both by the subject matter being taught and by the learners themselves. For a specific teaching approach to be effective and suitable, it should align with the characteristics of the students and the desired learning outcomes. When designing and selecting a teaching approach, it is crucial to consider not only the nature of the subject matter but also how students acquire knowledge. Therefore, educators utilize innovative teaching materials, procedures, strategies, and approaches to make learning relevant and beneficial. Over time, numerous methods and techniques have been developed to enhance mathematics education (Jagat, 2020).
        <br /><br />
        Mathematics teachers employ a variety of methods and techniques in their daily classroom instruction to enhance interactivity and effectiveness. Interaction between teachers and students is crucial for fostering engagement, and educators utilize new teaching materials, procedures, strategies, and approaches to ensure that learning is relevant and beneficial (Malik, Muhammad & Quayyum, 2015). With numerous methods and techniques available, mathematics teachers carefully select the most appropriate ones based on the topic, content, and needs of their students. At the elementary level, educators need to utilize various relevant methods in the mathematics classroom to fully grasp and master the subject matter. It has been observed that learners often solve problems quickly by employing different methods, techniques, or formulas that they have already learned in class. However, they may lack an understanding of the underlying logic behind these approaches. At first, Aristotle's deductive method was the sole approach used to solve problems. However, in the 17th century, Francis Bacon introduced inductive reasoning as a means to address mathematical problems.
        <br /><br />
        According to Hidalgo (2017), the act of teaching inductively has a psychological impact. By employing the inductive method, educators can cultivate curiosity among their students, which is crucial for the development of a nation. This teaching approach is endorsed by Pestalozzi and Francis Bacon. It revolves around the concept of induction in the context of teaching and learning. In the realm of mathematics, it involves formulating a formula based on a sufficient number of concrete, real-life examples. By employing this method, students engage with the content attentively and comprehend it at various levels. The inductive approach is particularly effective in topics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and arithmetic. It progresses from specific examples to general rules, from concrete illustrations to abstract principles, and from known concepts to unknown ones, ultimately leading students from simplicity to complexity. However, if not properly managed, the inductive teaching method can be time-consuming.
        <br /><br />
        The inductive method is based on the principle of induction. Induction means to establish a universal truth by showing that if it is true for a particular case and is further true for a reasonably adequate number of cases then it is true for all such cases. Thus, in this method, at the first stage, a problem is solved based on the previous knowledge, thinking, reasoning, and insight of the learner. At this stage, he does not know about any formula, principle or method for solving the given problem. When an adequate number of similar examples, facts or objects is presented to the learners, they try to conclude for all those. Thus, they arrive at a generalization or derive a formula through a convincing process of reasoning and solving various similar problems.
        <br /><br />
        The inductive approach is a teaching and learning method that relies on the process of induction. In the realm of mathematics, this approach involves constructing a formula by using a sufficient number of concrete, actual, and real examples. When students are taught mathematics using this method, they show great interest and understanding at various levels, particularly at the elementary level. The inductive method is especially beneficial in teaching and learning algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and arithmetic. It begins with specific examples and proceeds to establish general rules and formulas, moving from concrete illustrations to abstract concepts, from known information to unknowns, and from simple to complex situations.
        <br /><br />
        Deduction is the process by which a particular fact is derived from some generally known truth. Thus, in the deductive method of teaching the learner proceeds from general to particular, abstract to concrete and from formula to examples. Here a pre-established rule or formula is given to the learners and they are asked to solve the related problems by using that formula (Rajwinder, 2019). Therefore, in this method, the learner has to perform only calculations or simplify the substituted known values in the given formula to get the solution of the problem. According to Joseph London, “Deductive teaching secures first the learning of definition or law or rule, then carefully explains its meaning and lastly illustrates it fully by applying to fact.” Deductive reasoning is a process of confirming a rule or a hypothesis by showing that it will lead to something that is already assumed to be true. This is often misleading as a rule may work without a student finding out that it was an assumption that led to the confirmation of the rule. The student may not see that confirmation of the rule was the original intention. During the process, the student may completely forget the rule and change the topic to something irrelevant. This approach is primarily employed in the subjects of Algebra, Geometry, Arithmetic, and Trigonometry. It involves utilizing assumptions and educated guesses based on mathematical axioms. This method is commonly utilized for teaching mathematics at the secondary, higher secondary, or advanced levels (Malik, Muhammad & Quayyum, 2015).</p>

          Mathematics education often relies on a variety of teaching techniques to effectively convey concepts to students. One notable contrast in instructional strategies is between the inductive and deductive approaches. The inductive method involves using specific examples to derive general principles or rules, while the deductive method starts with general principles and applies them to specific instances. Educators must understand the impact of these methods on students' achievement in mathematics to improve teaching practices and optimize learning outcomes. Despite extensive research on teaching methods in mathematics education, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the comparative effectiveness of inductive and deductive approaches, particularly about student achievement. Therefore, the main focus of this study is to examine the effect of employing inductive and deductive teaching methods on students' achievement in mathematics.
