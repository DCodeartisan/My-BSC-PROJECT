        This study discussed the “Effect of inductive and deductive methods of teaching on secondary school students’ achievement in mathematics.” To achieve this, three research questions were formulated to guide this study. The research design adopted was a quasi-experimental, pre-test, post-test experimental and control design. An intact class was used for the purpose of the research. Purposive sampling technique was employed to select schools. One structured research instrument; the Mathematics Achievement Test (MAT) consisted of two sections, Section A and Section B. Section A focused on the personal data of the students such as age, sex, class, time duration, and name of school. Section B focused on 20 items objective test on Circle Geometry. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation was used to summarize the data. Inferential statistics which include Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to control the pre-test differences and examine the effect of the treatment, and Paired Samples T-test was used to compare the post-test scores between the experimental and control groups. The results of the study agreed with some existing researches stating that the inductive method is more effective in teaching senior secondary school mathematics.
